      <p>It is a survivor of the Ice Age, originating in the Late Pleistocene, around 300,000 years ago.[2] DNA sequencing and genetic studies reaffirm that the gray wolf is an ancestor of the domestic dog.</p>

      <p>The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae, and is further distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail.</p>

      <p>The weight and size of wolves vary greatly throughout the world, tending to increase proportionally with latitude, as predicted by Christian Bergmann's theory. In general, height, measured from the shoulders, varies from 60 to 95 centimeters.</p>

      <p>Weight varies geographically. On average, European wolves weigh 38.5 kg (84 lb); North American wolves, 36 kg (70 lb); Indian and Arabian wolves, 25 kg (55 lb).[7] Although rare, wolves weighing over 77 kg (177 lb) have been found in Alaska, Canada,[8] and the former Soviet Union.</p>

        <p>The wide range of habitats in which wolves can thrive reflects their adaptability as a species and includes temperate forests, mountains, tundra, taiga, grasslands and deserts. In North America, wolves are primarily predators of medium and large hooved mammals, such as moose, elk, white-tailed deer, mule deer, caribou, muskox and bison.</p>
        <p>Gray wolves have long legs that are well adapted to running, allowing them to move fast and travel far in search of food, and large skulls and jaws that are well suited to catching and feeding on large mammals. Wolves also have keen senses of smell, hearing and vision, which they use to detect prey and one another.</p>
